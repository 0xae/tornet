* In progress of defining publish function... this function depends upon chunk search function.

* Need to develop chunk KAD search
  - this search needs to return:
    - every node contacted
    - how often that chunk was queried on that node
    - whether that node is hosting the chunk
    - optionally stop searching after N hosting nodes are found.
