Overview
----------------------------------

This library provides the foundation of a P2P framework based upon UDP
message passing and remote procedure calls.  A UDT like protocol is layered
on top of UDP to provide flow control and retransmitting.  

What makes tornet different from other P2P systems is the utilization of
a digital currency to track contributions to the network and allow anonymous
users to purchase service.

All traffic is encrypted to prevent deep packet insepction.


This software is still under heavy development.
